# Algorithms and Data Structures-Princeton
Assignments -[Algorithms and Data Structures course of Princeton University][1], 
created by Princeton University, taught by: _Kevin Wayne_, Senior Lecturer and _Robert Sedgewick_,Professor.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs
to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and
scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. 

There are 4 main parts : 
1. Union Find | Stack | Queue
2. Sorting - Selection Sort | Insertion Sort | Merge Sort | Quick Sort | Heap Sort (Priority Queue ADT)
3. Searching - BST | Red Black BST | Hashing
4. Graph - Undirected | Directed | BFS | DFS | MST | Shortest Path

This codebase covers the first six assignments out of 8 in total, 
covering the 4 main parts.
All my assignments have score of above 95, 
so feel free to read them if you need any inspiration.

Assignment | Name | Part

1 | [Percolation][w1] | 1
2 | [Queues][w2] | 1
3 | [AutoComplete][w3] | 2
4 | [8 Puzzle][w4] | 2
5 | [Kd-Trees][w5] | 3
6 | [WordNet][w6] | 4

At the end, I wish you all a happy coding! :sunglasses::man_technologist:
